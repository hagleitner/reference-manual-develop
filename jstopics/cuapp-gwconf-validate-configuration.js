A operating system notification will pop up asking to allow the connection - confirm it to continue. If the gateway configuration was successful, the screen displays a confirmation message stating that the gateway is connected to the internet. If the gateway was configured but it can not establish an internet connection, a warning message will be displayed. Make sure that the LAN cable is connected to the gateways WAN port if the gateway is integrated in an Ethernet network.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r"
