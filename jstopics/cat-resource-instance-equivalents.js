They are the basis for cross device, cross firmware data analysis.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Each defined resource instance can be mapped to zero, one or more resource instance equivalents, one resource instance equivalent can map to zero or one resource instance within one firmware variant version.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Resource instance equivalents are typed, i.e. a resource instance can only link to resource instance equivalent if the data type of the resource instance is the same as the data type defined for the resource instance equivalent.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">A resource instance equivalent has a catalog element description.<\/p>\n\r"
