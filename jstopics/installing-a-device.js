hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">The Xibu App can be used to <a href=\"clse-device-installation.html\" class=\"topiclink\">install devices<\/a>. The serial number needed to install devices can be given by scanning the QR-Code on the device or by manually entering the device\'s serial number.<\/p>\n\r<h1 class=\"p_Heading1\"><span class=\"f_Heading1\">Possible problems<\/span><\/h1>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The device is already installed: A device can only be installed in one roon at one time. Therefore if you want to move a device you have to use the dedicated move procedure or uninstall the device first and then install it again to another room.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The provided serial number is wrong (especially with manual entry): Only devices known to HsM can be installed. Unknown devices will not be installed.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Only users with the appropriate permission on the customer can install devices to rooms of this customer.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">As the Xibu App can not check if the provided identification is identifying a device known to the HsM HsM Backend it will allow registration of any given serial number or QR code when in offline mode. The device registration might however fail when the offline data is synced back to the Client Service-.<\/p>\n\r<h1 class=\"p_Heading1\"><span class=\"f_Heading1\">Security considerations<\/span><\/h1>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">HsM assumes that you are owner of the device if you have access to the serial number of the device (either the QR code that encodes the serial number or the serial number printed in clear text on the device). The printed serial number on HsM devices are printed in a location that is only accessible if you have the appropriate hardware key to open the device.<\/p>\n\r"
