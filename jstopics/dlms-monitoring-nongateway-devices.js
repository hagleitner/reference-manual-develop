hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">Stationary gateways actively monitor the BLE communication links with BLE-networked devices and report the status of these links (online or offline) to the Data Link Monitoring Service. The technical environment on the stationary gateway allows an immediate detection of newly established BLE connections within a few seconds and lost device connections within about 10 seconds.<\/p>\n\r<div style=\"text-align: left; text-indent: 0; line-height: 1.44; padding: 0 0 0 0; margin: 0.3750rem 0 0.2500rem 0;\"><table class=\"BoxImportant\" >\n\r<tr class=\"BoxImportant\">\n\r<td class=\"BoxImportant\"><p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Note:<\/span> The actual time it takes for the Data Link Monitoring Service to detect devices that that go offline depends on different factors.

Changes can be newly connected BLE-networked devices, or lost connections. The information is sent as <a href=\"impr-messagetype-device-gateway-connection-status.html\" class=\"topiclink\">Device-gateway connection status<\/a> message.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>If a stationary gateway looses its connection to Azure IoT Hub (e.g. due to a lost internet connection) it will still detect and record changes in the connection status of BLE-networked devices and will deliver these status changes Data Link Monitoring Service once the connection to the Azure IoT Hub is re-established. Stationary gateways cache changes in a circular buffer for about 48 hours. The information is sent as <a href=\"impr-messagetype-device-gateway-connection-status.html\" class=\"topiclink\">Device-gateway connection status<\/a> message via Azure IoT Hub. This behavior also applies during the start-up phase of the gateway: Changes to the connection status of BLE-networked device collected before between the start-up of the gateway and establishing a connection to the Azure IoT Hub are recorded and sent to the IoT Hub once the connection is established.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>If a BLE-networked device looses connection to a stationary gateway while that gateway is offline and if then the gateway is then rebooted (and therefore looses its buffer) the status change to offline of that device will never reach the Data Link Monitoring Service. To recover from these (extremely rare) cases of devices falsely considered as online the stationary gateway sends all its connected devices once every 6 hours. The  Data Link Monitoring Service can therefore rely that it gets information about every connected device once every 6 hours. Devices that do not get an update for more than 6 h are therefore always considered as offline.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r"
