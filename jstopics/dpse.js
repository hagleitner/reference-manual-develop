hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">HsM uses an <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Azure Device Provisioning Service<\/span> for gateway devices so that these devices will initially connect to the right HsM HsM Backend infrastructure. The Device Provisioning Service therefore facilitates the possibility of multiple instances of a HsM HsM Backend e.g. for OEM Partners running instances of HsM. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">After production (as part of the digital twin\'s birth process) each gateway device is registered with the Device Provisioning Service. The registration record links the gateway device to a specific Azure IoT Hub and it provides the keys for the device to be able to communicate with the Device Provisioning Service.<\/p>\n\r"
