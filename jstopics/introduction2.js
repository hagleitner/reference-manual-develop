hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">HsM supports the concept of compound devices, i.e. devices can include other devices. These devices within other devices, however, are more than just components: they have their own device id, they can often also be used as stand-alone devices, they can be moved to another compound device, etc.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The MLE (Modulare Leerstandseinheit) is an example of a device type that can exist as a standalone device or can be part of a compound device like the multifold or the paper box.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The catalog service supports compound device types as part of the device type definition. This is implemented as device type placeholders that define the logical location within the compound device type as well as the device type of the compound member type. I.e. device type placeholders are typed with a specific device type.<\/p>\n\r"
