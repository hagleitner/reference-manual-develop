In general HsM assigns permissions to specific security principals for specific securables.

Permissions and roles are predefined by HsM and cannot be modified.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Note: a permission can be assigned for a specific principal on a specific securable but may only have effect on securables on lower levels. E.g. a principal might be assigned the EDIT_CUSTOMER permission on a specific organization. This permission however only grants access to all customers within this organization but does not grant any access on the organization itself. The securable in this example is the organization, however the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">affected securable<\/span> is the customer.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Permissions with an affected securable cannot be assigned to securables that are lower in the hierarchy than the affected securable. E.g. EDIT_ORGANIZATION cannot be assigned to a customer securable. Every role has a target securable and only roles with a matching target securable can be assigned to a securable of that type. A role only groups permissions with an affected securable the same as the target securable of the role or an affected securable with a lower level than the target securable.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">HsM uses an additive permission model. I.e. all permissions grant some kind of access to securables, they never revoke or deny access. Security principals that were not assigned any permission cannot access or modify any data in HsM and cannot perform any operations within the system.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r"
