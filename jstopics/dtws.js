It is the place where digital twins for each produced HsM device are initially registered and maintained throughout the life-cycle of the device. The Digital Twin Service provides the interfaces for production processes to register devices, it is therefore the midwife that facilitates the digital birth of devices and the registration office that knows the truth of the life-cycle of a device.<\/p>\n\r"
