hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">The Cloud To Device Distribution Service manages tasks that initiate different types of actions on HsM devices (BLE-networked devices as well as gateway devices). E.g. the Cloud To Device Distribution Service can manage tasks that will initiate the writing of specific resource instance values on a specific device.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">If the recipient device is a BLE-networked devices it cannot be directly accessed from the Cloud To Device Distribution Service, therefore the service cares about finding the gateway that has access to the recipient device. Once having identified the right gateway device the Cloud To Device Distribution Service uses Azure IoT Hub for direct-method-calls to this gateway device. These direct-method-calls &nbsp;will start processes on the gateway device that will eventually fulfill the task by triggering the appropriate actions on the recipient device.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Results of the process started on the gateway device are published by the gateway device via messages to the <a href=\"impr.html\" class=\"topiclink\">IoT Event Hub<\/a>. The Cloud To Device Distribution Service consumes these messages to learn about the result of the processes started on the gateway devices via direct-method-calls.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The Cloud To Device Distribution Service works asynchronous. After accepting a task requested by a client it may take anywhere from a few milliseconds to days or even months for the tasks to be completed. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">All the uncertainties in the communication path from the requesting client via the Cloud To Device Distribution Service, the Azure IoT Hub, the gateway device and the final recipient are managed by the Cloud To Device Distribution Service in a very robust way. However there are certain situations that cannot be detected or resolved by the Cloud To Device Distribution Service and therefore there are some <a href=\"c2dd-limitations.html\" class=\"topiclink\">limitations<\/a> the user should be aware of.<\/p>\n\r"
