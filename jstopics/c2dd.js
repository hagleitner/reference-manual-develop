hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">The cloud to device delivery service (C2DD) accepts messages addressed to HsM devices (BLE-networked devices as well as gateway devices) and tries to deliver these messages via Azure IoT Hub. The delivery of these messages is an asynchronous process that might take everywhere from a few ms to days to be completed. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">All messages accepted by the C2DD are addressed to a single networked component (i.e. usually also to a single device).<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r"
