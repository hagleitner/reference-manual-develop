It covers all aspects of HsM and includes information for the occasional system user, power users, administrators, third party developers and decision makers. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">It is not intended to be a step-by-step guide that shows you how to solve a particular problem, but gives you the knowledge that enables you to use HsM in a way that fits best to your requirements. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">This Reference Manual does not require any prior knowledge of HsM but a good general understanding of IT systems is surely necessary.<\/p>\n\r"
