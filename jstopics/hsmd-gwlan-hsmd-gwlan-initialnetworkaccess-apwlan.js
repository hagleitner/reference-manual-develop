hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">In its initial configuration a gateway acts as WLAN access point, clients can connect to this WLAN network (<span class=\"f_Term\">AP-WLAN<\/span>) in which the gateway itself is a station and can then access and configure the gateway. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The SSID of the AP-WLAN conforms to the regex pattern <span class=\"f_CodeExample\">HsM-Gw-LAN-[0-9a-f]{6}<\/span> where the last 6 letters are the last 6 digits of the MAC address the Gateway uses for all its network interfaces &nbsp;(this address is also part of the device\'s <a href=\"device-with-network-interface(.html\" class=\"topiclink\">QR-code<\/a>). The password to connect to the AP-WLAN is a unique random string for each device. The gateway runs a DHCP Service on the AP-WLAN that issues IP addresses from the <span class=\"f_CodeExample\">192.168.2.0\/255<\/span> subnet. The Gateway itself is assigned the <span class=\"f_CodeExample\">192.168.2.1<\/span> IP address. Note that all these settings and configurations are the defaults set at the time of production of the device and may be changed by the gateway operator, however you can always <a href=\"hsmd-gwlan-resetbutton.html\" class=\"topiclink\">reset<\/a> the gateway to factory settings to return to these defaults.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The Xibu App uses the AP-WLAN to connect to the gateway during configuration. To make this as easy as possible the gateways AP-WLAN SSID, the WLAN Password and the root password are stored in the Digital Twin Service and are also shipped as special QR-Code together with the device (this is useful when configuring a gateway while not having internet access)<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"> The password is shipped together with the gateway and is also stored in the Digital Twin Service. <\/p>\n\r<div style=\"text-align: left; text-indent: 0; line-height: 1.44; padding: 0 0 0 0; margin: 0.3750rem 0 0.2500rem 0;\"><table style=\"width:43.7500rem; border:none; border-spacing:0; border-collapse:collapse;\">\n\r<tr>\n\r<td style=\"vertical-align:top; padding:0.1250rem; border:solid thin #e1e1e1;\"><p class=\"p_Normal\"><span class=\"f_Tableheader\">Note<\/span>: If necessary, e.g. due to security policies, these settings can be changed via the gateway\'s Web Page or via SSH. Automatic configuration routines in the Xibu App may fail with custom configurations, HsM OEM Partner can only provide limited support with custom configurations.<\/p>\n\r<\/td>\n\r<\/tr>\n\r<\/table>\n\r<\/div>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The AP-WLAN is always started when the gateways is powered on. Only when changing some network configuration of the gateway (and therefore rebooting the network stack) this AP-WLAN might be down for a while. In these case allow up to 2 minutes for the AP-WLAN to be available again.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">You can use the <a href=\"hsmd-gwlan-resetbutton.html\" class=\"topiclink\">reset button<\/a> to enable or disable the AP-WLAN.<\/p>\n\r"
