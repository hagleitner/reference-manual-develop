hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">HsM is designed as a single system for all data of an HsM OEM Partner, i.e. all the data that is recorded and managed for all customers and organizations of the HsM OEM Partner. Each service within the HsM backend is designed and developed so that it scales nicely with growing amount of data. However the implementation and also the hardware used for hosting of HsM is based upon a quantity structure that describes what the system is capable of in terms of data storage, processing etc.<\/p>\n\r"
