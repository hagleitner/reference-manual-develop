hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">Out of the box Gateways act as WLAN Access Point therefore clients can connect to this WLAN Network (AP-WLAN) in which the gateway itself is a station and can therefore access the gateway. &nbsp;The SSID of the WLAN the Access Point provides is conforms to the regex pattern <span class=\"f_CodeExample\">HsM-Gw-LAN-[0-9a-f]{6}<\/span> where the last 6 letters are the last 6 digits of the MAC address the Gateway uses for all its NICs. The password to connect to the WLAN is unique for each device. It is delivered together with the gateway but is also stored in the Digital Twin Service. The gateway runs a DHCP Service for this WLAN that issues IP addresses from the 192.168.2.0\/255 subnet. The Gateway itself is assigned the 192.168.2.1 IP address.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">For configuring the Gateway via wired networks the gateway can be connected via Ethernet to your LAN. Out of the Box the gateway\'s WAN Ethernet network interface is configured as DHCP client, i.e. will try to get its IP address from a DHCP server in your LAN.<\/p>\n\r<div style=\"text-align: left; text-indent: 0; line-height: 1.44; padding: 0 0 0 0; margin: 0.3750rem 0 0.2500rem 0;\"><table style=\"width:43.7500rem; border:none; border-spacing:0; border-collapse:collapse;\">\n\r<tr>\n\r<td style=\"vertical-align:top; padding:0.1250rem; border:solid thin #e1e1e1;\"><p class=\"p_Normal\"><span class=\"f_Tableheader\">Note<\/span>: The HsM Xibu App uses the gateways access point WLAN. When connected to the internet the SSID and WLAN password for the Gateway can be queried from the HsM backend.

Automatic configuration routines in the Xibu App will be limited then and the owner has to remember the SSID and password.<\/p>\n\r<\/td>\n\r<\/tr>\n\r<\/table>\n\r<\/div>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">This gateway\'s AP-WLAN is always started when the gateways is powered on. Only when changing some network configuration of the gateway (and therefore rebooting the network stack) this AP-WLAN might be down for a while. In these case allow up to 2 minutes for the AP-WLAN to be available again.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">You can use the <a href=\"reset-button.html\" class=\"topiclink\">reset button<\/a> to enable or disable the AP-WLAN.<\/p>\n\r"
